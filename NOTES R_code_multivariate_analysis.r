How the different communities are changing in time
And how we can monitor the changes

Start with in-situ data collection
Going out in the field to get information about the species that live in the field

We are dealing with communities. Also, soil, temperature, pH etc

Butterflies first plot - 13 , second plot - 1 and third plot - 2
Orchys: first plot - 15, second plot - 2 and third plot - 3
Larix: first plot - 3, second plot - 10 and third plot - 8

See how the 3 species are related to each other
One manner to see this data. 
Do a matrix/table of each plot. And see where the species have been find + how many individuals
As we can see the butterflies and orchys are more related, rather than butterflies and tree

Take number of the individuals as the value of the 
x-axis = plot 1 
y-axis = plot 2 
z-axis = plot 3 

Species that are more related are closer to each other
Species that are less related are farer away

The functional relationship, in our case, is the relationship between butterflies and orchys
Study ecosystem functions and relationships. Which have been studied in a certain area

What if we use 4 plots?
How to show 4 plots in such a graph?
It is impossible. We can only see 3 dimensions. 
The fourth one is time

How to reduce a 4th dimension model into a 3th dimension object?
Several plots. That should be reduced into 2 dimensions
Multi=Several
Varib=variables

The variation is seen 
Explain the variation. To show the variation. 
To see the variation, you need the variations in plot 1 and plot 2
Plot 1 explained 50% of variation. Same for plot 2
Component 1 explain 90% of the variation, and component 2 explain 10%

Takin plots in space somewhere, and each plot have different species. 
The species are different distribute in the plots. Count the species
Use the number of individuals as coordinates
See correlations between species
Multivariate analysis -taking several plots - redesign them to see them into 2D

Intro - Description of the Dataset
Based on thinking of different plots
Matrix of 
Tropical Forest - Biomes. High amount of evaporation, rain, light
All plants can live together. High biodiversity. 
Broadleaf continental forest - Biome
Coniferous forest
Artic Tundra
